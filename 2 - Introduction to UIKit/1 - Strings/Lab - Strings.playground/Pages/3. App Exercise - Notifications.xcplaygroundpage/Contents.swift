 Occasionally users of your fitness tracking app will beat previous goals or records. You may want to notify them when this happens for encouragement purposes. Create a new constant `congratulations` and assign it a string literal that uses string interpolation to create the following string:
 
- "Congratulations, <INSERT USER'S FULL NAME HERE>! You beat your previous daily high score of <INSERT PREVIOUS HIGHEST STEPS HERE> steps by walking <INSERT NEW HIGHEST STEPS HERE> steps yesterday!"
 
 Insert `fullName`, `previousBest` and `newBest` where indicated. Print the value of `congratulations`.
